## ‚ùØ Usage

There are a couple of commands we want to keep an eye on when developing and building for production, these are listed below:

### Development

| Command           | Description |
| ---------------- | --- |
| `npm run serve`  | Starts up and a development server using webpack to watch the files. |
| `npm run debug`  | This command does the same as the `serve` command, however, it launches the server with the node `inspect` feature. |
| `npm run clean`  | This removes any extraneous files in the public directory along with removing the build directory. |


‚Ñπ These development commands launch the client and server side code using Webpacks HMR. The views are automatically hard refreshed.


### Production

| Command           | Description |
| ---------------- | --- |
| `npm run start`  | Starts the application using the built files. |
| `npm run build`  | Creates a production build of the client and server and outputs them in `public` and `build` respectively. |

‚Ñπ The production build commands are required before the server can be launched.
